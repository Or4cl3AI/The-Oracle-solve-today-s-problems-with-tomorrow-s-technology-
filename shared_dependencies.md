The shared dependencies between the files are:

1. Function Names: All three Python files (software_engineer.py, finance_and_marketing.py, video_game_designer.py) have a function named `generate_solution(problem)`. This function is used to generate a solution based on the problem input.

2. Imported Libraries: Each file imports a specific library at the beginning. The software_engineer.py file imports tensorflow as tf, the finance_and_marketing.py file imports pytorch as torch, and the video_game_designer.py file imports sklearn. These libraries are used to create the models in the `generate_solution(problem)` function.

3. No exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, or message names are shared between these files as they are Python and Markdown files, not JavaScript or database files.
