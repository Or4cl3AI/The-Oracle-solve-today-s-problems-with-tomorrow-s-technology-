Based on the user's prompt, the shared dependencies between the files "setup.py", "issue_fixer.py", and "main.py" could be:

1. "config_data": This could be a shared data schema that contains configuration settings for the app. All three files might need to access these settings.

2. "issue_data": This could be another shared data schema that contains information about the issues that need to be fixed. "issue_fixer.py" would primarily use this, but "setup.py" and "main.py" might also need to access it.

3. "app_status": This could be an exported variable that represents the current status of the app (e.g., whether it's fully set up, whether there are any issues). All three files might need to check and update this status.

4. "setup_complete": This could be a message name that's sent when the setup is complete. "setup.py" would send this message, and "main.py" might listen for it.

5. "issue_fixed": This could be another message name that's sent when an issue is fixed. "issue_fixer.py" would send this message, and "main.py" might listen for it.

6. "init_setup": This could be a function name in "setup.py" that initiates the setup process. "main.py" might need to call this function.

7. "fix_issue": This could be a function name in "issue_fixer.py" that fixes an issue. "main.py" might need to call this function.

8. "start_app": This could be a function name in "main.py" that starts the app. "setup.py" and "issue_fixer.py" might need to call this function after they've done their jobs.

Please note that these are just potential shared dependencies based on the user's prompt. The actual shared dependencies would depend on the specific requirements of the app and how it's designed.
