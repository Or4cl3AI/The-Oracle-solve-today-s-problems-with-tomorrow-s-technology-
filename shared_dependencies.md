The shared dependencies between the files are:

1. Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn. These are imported in both "train.py" and "generate_solution.py".

2. Function Names: "train_models()" in "train.py" and "generate_solution()" in "generate_solution.py". These functions are the main execution points in their respective files.

3. Python's built-in "__name__" and "__main__" variables: These are used in both "train.py" and "generate_solution.py" to ensure that the main function is executed only when the script is run directly, and not when it's imported as a module.

4. The problem categories: 'business idea' and 'technical problem'. These are used in the "generate_solution()" function in "generate_solution.py" to determine which model to use for generating a solution.

Please note that there are no exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, or message names shared between these files as they are not web-based and do not interact with a database or a front-end interface.
