Shared dependencies between "The_Oracle/data/train_data.csv" and "The_Oracle/scripts/train.py" include:

1. Data Schema: The structure of the data in "train_data.csv" file is a shared dependency as it will be used in "train.py" for training the model.

2. Function Names: The function "train(data)" in "train.py" is a shared dependency as it uses the data from "train_data.csv" to train the model.

3. TensorFlow Library: The TensorFlow library is a shared dependency as it is used in "train.py" to define, compile, and train the model.

4. Model Variables: The model variables defined in "train.py" (model, optimizer, loss, metrics) are shared dependencies as they are used to train the model using the data from "train_data.csv".

5. File Path: The file path to "train_data.csv" is a shared dependency as it will be used in "train.py" to load the data for training the model.
